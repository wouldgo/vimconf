Contributing
------------
Suggestions, ideas and bug fixes are encouraged. If you feel something is
amiss, head over to the issue tracker and create an
[issue](https://github.com/timss/vimconf/issues).

Remember to include Vim version, any changes you've done to your local
configuration (`$HOME/.vimrc.lasts` etc), what you've tried or other relevant
information.

If there's a bug with a plugin use the official bug or issue tracker of said
plugin.

Mantra
------
Contributions should adhere to the mantra of vimconf:

> The core principle behind vimconf is to deliver an easy to install
> configuration with sane defaults and non-invasive plugins. It should be easy
> to pick up and use, but at the same time make room for personal changes.
